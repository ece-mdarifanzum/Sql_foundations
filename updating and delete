Delete -
Delete deletes the records from the table, if there is no where clause then it deletes all the records. But delete gives us the option to rollback (you will understand this during transaction control)  i.e. in short it allows us to revert the deletion and bring back the deleted records when a transaction is active. Where as truncate doesn't give us this option, and moreover truncate doesn't support where clause.

Update -
Update allows us to update the field values, like delete, if there is no where clause it updates all the records otherwise it will only update those records which match the where condition.

update Person set ownAHouse = 1;
 
-- Updates only those records whose name is 'A' and sets the address field

update Person set address = 'Addr99'

update Person set dob = '2001-05-21'
where dob = null;
 
-- Updates the dob field value to the given value where the field value
-- is null.
 
update Person set dob = '2001-05-21'
where dob is null;
 
 
-- deletes those records whose name is AB
delete from Person
where name = 'AB';
 
-- truncate the entire table Person.
