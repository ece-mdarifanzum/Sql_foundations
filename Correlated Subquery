-- Normal sub query and if you observe the subquery output is static 
-- i.e. it just returns the HR department ID and the same value could 
-- be used for the entire outer query.
-- it is almost like select * from Employee where DeptID = 3;
 
select * from Employee where DeptId = (select DeptId from Dept where Name = 'HR');
 
-- Translation of above query using correlated subquery.
 
-- In case of this query the reference to e.DeptId is made which is an outer
-- query column. And this column value changes for each record in the Employee table
-- and hence the subquery need to be evaluated for each record. And this is slightly 
-- in efficient.
 
-- Here it the inner query check for the existence of a record with employees departmentId
-- whose name is HR. If record exists then Employee record is selected otherwise not.
 
select * from Employee as e
where 
exists (select * from Dept where DeptId = e.DeptId and Name = 'HR');
 
-- Translation using JOIN.
-- Most of the times JOIN might turns out to be a better option.
 
select e.* from Employee as e
INNER JOIN Dept as d ON (e.DeptId = d.DeptId and d.Name = 'HR');
